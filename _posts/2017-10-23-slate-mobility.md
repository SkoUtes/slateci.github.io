SLATE (Services Layer at the Edge) is
a new project that, when complete, will implement
“cyberinfrastructure as code” by augmenting the
canonical Science DMZ pattern with a generic,
programmable, secure and trusted underlayment
platform.

This platform will host advanced
container-centric services needed for higher-level
capabilities such as data transfer nodes, software
and data caches, workflow services and science
gateway components. SLATE will use best-of-breed
data center virtualization components, and where
available, software defined networking, to enable
distributed automation of deployment and service
lifecycle management tasks by domain experts. As
such it will simplify creation of scalable platforms
that connect research teams, institutions and
resources to accelerate science while reducing
operational costs and development cycle times.
Since SLATE will be designed to require only
commodity components for its functional layers, its
potential for building distributed systems should
extend across all data center types and scales, thus
enabling creation of ubiquitous, science-driven
cyberinfrastructure. By providing automation and programmatic interfaces to distributed HPC back-
ends and other cyberinfrastructure resources, SLATE will amplify the reach of science gateways
and therefore the domain communities they support.
