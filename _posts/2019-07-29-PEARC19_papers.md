## Developing Science Apps on SLATE
Development of service containers for deployment on distributed environments is difficult. MiniSLATE can install a local copy of the SLATE developer's environment on a Mac or Linux. Jason Still presented on how to use MiniSLATE for packaging applications targeted for the SLATE platform.

## SLATE Security Architecture
The SLATE team is creating its architecture with security in mind.  Managing Privilege and Access on a federated platform as well providing a curated catalog of applications are two of the strategies the SLATE team is using to approach security.  Chris Weaver presented these approaches in this paper.
