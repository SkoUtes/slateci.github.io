The [SLATE API Server](http://slateci.io/docs/concepts/software-components/api-server.html), [SLATE Federation](http://slateci.io/docs/federation/) and other aspects of the SLATE architecture utilize a [REST](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) interface.  This interface exposes the various actions and methods of SLATE to a browser based interaction.
