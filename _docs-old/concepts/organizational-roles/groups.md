A community of researchers from a science domain on a SLATE platform.
The SLATE Group is the root of trust and authorization
for a community working on a SLATE platform. The SLATE Group is also the unit of
resource allocation for SLATE edge clusters. For purpose of SLATE, we consider
only the members that play a role in creating the computing infrastructure
(i.e. develop/install/maintain software, manage data quality/storage/transfer, â€¦)
and not all the researchers that have access to those resources. That is, only
these people need access to tools and resources from the SLATE platform.

Examples:
* Research collaborations (ATLAS, CMS, LIGO, XENON1T, SPT...)
* Communities from [Science Gateways](https://sciencegateways.org/)
* Domain-specific platforms and support organizations (Science Gateways, iPlant, NanoHub, Galaxy...)

Requirements:
* Activities of different research organizations within the same SLATE platform
should be isolated from each other


Responsibilities:
* Authorizing science applications developers and users to act within a namespace
* Managing resource limits applied by the SLATE platform
