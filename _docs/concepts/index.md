## Roles

There are several roles which are useful for describing how SLATE works and is used. 
These are not exclusive; one person may fill several roles at different times. 

### Cluster Administrator

Any person who runs an edge Kubernetes cluster that is joined to the SLATE federation is considered the administrator of the cluster. SLATE is granted only limited access to participating clusters, so cluster administrators retain overall control of their resources. Cluster Administrators are responsible for keeping their clusters running and accessible to SLATE (as long as they choose to participate in the federation). 

### Application Administrator

Any person who runs one or more service applications on SLATE is considered an Application Administrator. Application Administrators are responsible for keeping their services running, although there can be circumstances in which they may need to confer with the Cluster Administrator for the cluster on which they are running or want to run. 

### Application Developer

An Application Developer, for SLATE purposes, is a person who packages and maintains an application for use on SLATE. This does not require having written the application in the first place. New applications and changes made by Application Developer are reviewed and approved by a Platform Application Reviewer. 

### Platform Administrator

SLATE Platform Administrators operate the central SLATE API server and web portal. For the reference platform this is done by the SLATE developers. They are responsible for ensuring that these central services work correctly, and mediate among the concerns of other participants in the platform. 

### Platform Application Reviewer

Platform Application Reviewers are responsible for examining additions and changes to the catalog of applications available to be run by SLATE to ensure that they work and have appropriate security considerations. At this time application review is performed by the SLATE developers.
