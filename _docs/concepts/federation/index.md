The concept of federated [SLATE Edge Clusters](http://slateci.io/docs/concepts/hardware-components/edge-cluster.html) is a fundamental tenet that eases deployment of scientific software and gateway services with minimal effort from local system administrators. With appropriate permissions, an [application developer](http://slateci.io/docs/concepts/individual-roles/application-developer.html) or [application administrator](http://slateci.io/docs/concepts/individual-roles/application-administrator.html) can deploy one or more instances of an application across multiple sites within the context of a specific [Groups](http://slateci.io/docs/concepts/organizational-roles/groups.html).

Federation is the mechanism that allows a set of [SLATE Edge Cluster](http://slateci.io/docs/concepts/hardware-components/edge-cluster.html) to participate together to form a [SLATE Platform](http://slateci.io/docs/concepts/hardware-components/platform.html).  Each [SLATE Edge Cluster](http://slateci.io/docs/concepts/hardware-components/edge-cluster.html) operates as a distinct set of master node and worker nodes unique to a site.  Users will be able to deploy applications across a federated [SLATE Platform](http://slateci.io/docs/concepts/hardware-components/platform.html) with the [SLATE command line interface](http://slateci.io/docs/concepts/software-components/cli.html), the SLATE web interface or via the [SLATE REST API]().
