Many science workflows require specific applications and configurations, and properly deploying everything necessary for these workflows can be a time-consuming process for cluster administrators and IT professionals. When an application is developed or packaged and moved to the SLATE application catalog, deployment on a SLATE cluster takes just a handful of commands and far less time.

The online SLATE sandbox can be used to see just how quickly applications can be deployed to a SLATE cluster.

## Using SLATE

The primary way to utilize SLATE is through the SLATE Client Command Line Interface, or Client CLI. The Client CLI allows users to configure and deploy applications at a number of SLATE production clusters with just a handful of commands. An installation and usage guide can be found below:

## SLATE Ecosystem

The primary roles in the SLATE ecosystem are [SLATE Application Developers]() and [SLATE Cluster Administrators]().
- [Application Developers]({{home}}/docs/quickstart/roles/dev-content.html) work to create new applications and package existing applications to be deployed on SLATE Clusters.
- [Cluster Administrators]({{home}}/docs/quickstart/roles/it-content.html) spin up and maintain new SLATE clusters.
