Welcome [SLATE Application Developer!](http://slateci.io/docs/concepts/individual-roles/application-developer.html)

To develop applications for SLATE you will need to familiarize yourself with the SLATE platform and the technologies it is built upon (docker, kubernetes and helm).

We suggest you follow the basic SLATE tutorial first:

<div id="doc-call" class="container-fluid doc-call-container ">
    <div class="row doc-call-row">
        <div class="col-md-10 nofloat center-block">
            <div class="col-sm-9 text-center nofloat center-block">
                <a href="https://sandbox.slateci.io"><button class="btn btn-slate">Try SLATE now!</button></a>    
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

When you are familiar with the SLATE command-line, we suggest you look at the [SLATE Application Developer guide](https://slateci.io/docs/developers/). You can use this in conjunction with the mini-SLATE development environment.

<div id="doc-call" class="container-fluid doc-call-container ">
    <div class="row doc-call-row">
        <div class="col-md-10 nofloat center-block">
            <div class="col-sm-9 text-center nofloat center-block">
                <a href="https://github.com/slateci/minislate"><button class="btn btn-slate">Download mini-SLATE dev kit</button></a>    
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

You will have a small version of the whole SLATE reference platform and you will be able to grab existing packages in the SLATE stable and dev catalogs.  If you are using the dev catalog, don't forget the ["--dev" flag](http://slateci.io/docs/quickstart/slate-client.html#deploying-an-application)!
