[Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/) is a caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. It reduces bandwidth and improves
response times by caching and reusing frequently-requested web pages. [Frontier](http://frontier.cern.ch/)
uses squid as part of its distributed database caching system which distributes data from data sources
to many clients around the world.

This application delivers the version of the Frontier Squid components as packaged
by the [Open Science Grid](http://opensciencegrid.org/).

The deployment of additional cacheing servers is particularly important, since 
they allow for a more wide-spread use of StashCache to serve data to jobs.
