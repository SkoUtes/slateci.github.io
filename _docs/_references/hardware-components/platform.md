A collection of SLATE edge clusters accessed as a single entity. A SLATE cluster may participate in more than one platform.

Examples:
* The SLATE Reference Platform.
* A science collaboration uses SLATE to deploy a network of intelligent data delivery services. 
* A research computing center deploys a SLATE-enabled Kubernetes cluster to join a national research platform.
