Applications that have been validated for deployment on a SLATE platform can be found in the
[SLATE application catalog](https://portal.slateci.io/applications).

Applications in the catalog are packaged by the SLATE team and by the community, and are reviewed to make sure
they follow best practices. They should be installable with minimal knowledge of the overall infrastructure and
should satisfy site requirements in terms of cyber-security and manageability.

To install an application, please refer to the [SLATE Client documentation](http://slateci.io/docs/quickstart/slate-client.html).
